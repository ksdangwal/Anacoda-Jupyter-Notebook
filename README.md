A server extension for jupyter notebook which provides configuration interfaces for notebook extensions (nbextensions).

The jupyter_nbextensions_configurator jupyter server extension provides graphical user interfaces for configuring which nbextensions 
are enabled (load automatically for every notebook). In addition, for nbextensions which include an appropriate yaml descriptor file 
(see below), the interface also renders their markdown readme files, and provides controls to configure the nbextensions' options.
